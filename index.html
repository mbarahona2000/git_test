        <h1>How Jesus has changed me:</h1>
        <p1>The purpose of this blog is to remind myself where God has put me and to trust him always.</p1>
        <h2>My experience:</h2>
        <p>Throughout my life I have experienced several issues, probably not bigger than people living at countries at war</p>
        <p>But at the end of the day I guess we live all experiences differently, and at the end of the day, that's what <em>life</em> is about</p>
        <p><h2>What does Jesus have to do?</h2></p>
        <p>Well, <strong>Jesus</strong> has been my only friend, he sometimes as a father wants us to experience life first hand before helping us.
        This world is full of evil because we were born evil, no human can be trusted, so Jesus is the light in the darkness,he never said it would be easy,
        even the prophets suffered and now I think to myself, Jesus has given me the bread, my wage, my brain and the air I breath. As if that's not enough, he's given me ideas.
        Ideas about him, about what to learn and about work, really in this world he is all I have. </p>
